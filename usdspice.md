# $SPICE

The Arrakis DAO coordinates the management of its tokenized strategies with its curated _list of automated strategies_ from which the protocol will take a 25% commission on fees (2.5% is currently being charged) earned from all liquidity under management, as protocol revenue. In turn, projects get optimized liquidity without the management overhead, and crucially, access to _liquidity gauge emissions_ of $SPICE.

These $SPICE emissions provide additional incentives for LPs and attract “sticky” liquidity to vaults, while doubling as a bootstrapping mechanism for distributing governance power over the Arrakis protocol by vote locking $SPICE for non-transferable $xSPICE. The tokenomics of $SPICE and $xSPICE are inspired by Curve’s explosively popular _**ve**_ design, with a number of important differences (outlined in detail in a forthcoming post) optimized in order to fit and grow Arrakis’ future product fleet.

At the genesis of Arrakis and the $SPICE economy, there will be an initial distribution of $SPICE, including an airdrop spanning a few key demographics. Details about the $SPICE distribution and eligibility will be released soon.
